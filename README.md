# Introduction to APIs

<!--- [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/blue442/DS875/HEAD) -->

This contains a set of notebooks used for an interactive introduction to using APIs with the Python language. 

There are two notebooks in this repo - the first ([Intro_to_APIs.ipynb](https://github.com/blue442/DS875/blob/main/Intro_to_APIs.ipynb)) is designed to introduce the basics of interacting with APIs using GET and POST requests. This can be run in a [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) environment by clicking the following link: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/blue442/DS875/blob/main/notebooks/Intro_to_APIs.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>. Note that in order to use colab, you will have to sign in to a google account, and you will get a warning that the notebook was not authored by google (and that's okay).

The second notebook ([fastapi.ipynb](https://github.com/blue442/DS875/blob/main/fastapi.ipynb)) contains an example implementation of a very basic API service running in a notebook that is built utilizing the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) framework. This can also be run in the colab environment by clicking here: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/blue442/DS875/blob/main/notebooks/building_an_api.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

<!--- These notebooks can be run using the [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) service by clicking on the Binder button located at the top of this readme, or if you navigate to either notebook they will contain a button at the top to launch using the [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) service. -->

<!-- These notebooks can be run interactively online in a free virtual environment by using the [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) service. To do so, just navigate to either notebook (in the 'notebook' folder),  and they will contain a button at the top that will launch them in the colab environment. -->
